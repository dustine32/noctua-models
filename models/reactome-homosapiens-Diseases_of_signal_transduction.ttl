                "Proteins with transporting functions can be roughly classified into 3 categories: ATP hydrolysis-coupled pumps, ion channels, and transporters. Pumps utilize the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to power the movement of substrates across the membrane against their electrochemical gradient. Channels in their open state can transfer substrates (ions or water) down their electrochemical gradient at an extremely high efficiency (up to 108 s-1). Transporters facilitate the movement of a specific substrate either against or with their concentration gradient at a lower speed (about 102 -104 s-1); as generally believed, conformational change of the transporter protein is involved in the transfer process. Diseases caused by defects in these transporter proteins are detailed in this section. Currently, disorders associated with ABC transporters are annotated here (Dean 2005)." ;

                "Neurodegenerative diseases manifest as the progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons, which is frequently accompanied by formation of misfolded protein deposits in the brain. Classification of neurodegenerative diseases is based on clinical symptoms, which depend on the anatomical region affected by neuronal dysfunction, the identity of misfolded proteins and cellular and subcellular pathology.<br>In Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), beta-amyloid protein (APP) deposits form in the extracellular space, where they can make plaques, while abnormally phosphorylated tau protein (MAPT) accumulates in neuronal cells.<br>Beside AD, neuronal and/or glial inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau are also found in Pick disease (PiD), neurofibrillary tangle-dementia (NFT), primary age-related tauopathy (PART), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) and globular glial tauopathies (GGT).<br>In prion disease, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, deposits of PrP protein are formed mostly in the extracellular and presynaptic space. PrP deposits in neuronal cell bodies are mainly confined to endosomes and lysosomes, which is attributed to neuronal uptake of pathological proteins and intercellular prion spreading.<br>In Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), deposits of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) are formed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies and neurites. In multiple system atrophy (MSA), deposits of alpha-synuclein form in the cytoplasm of glial cells (Papp-Lantos bodies).<br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are characterized by ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, commonly known as TDP-43), a protein that normally localizes to the nucleus. Pathological TDP-43 inclusions have been associated with the TDP-43 gene mutations, as well as mutations in several other genes, including C9orf72, GRN, VCP, SQSTM1, DCTN1 and OPTN. TDP-43 inclusions have also been reported in AD, DLB, hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.<br>FUS protein-positive inclusion bodies are found in familial ALS, caused by mutations in the FUS gene, as well as in a small subgroup of FTLD-related diseases. FUS-positive inclusions may be accompanied by FET protein-positive inclusions.<br>For a detailed review of molecular pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, please refer to Kovacs 2016.<br>Within this broad domain, the process by which APP-triggered deregulation of CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) triggers multiple neurodegenerative pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease has been annotated." ;

                "The WNT signaling pathway has been linked with cancer ever since the identification of the first WNT as a gene activated by integration of mouse mammary tumor virus proviral DNA in virally-induced breast tumors (Nusse et al, 1984). The most well known example of aberrant WNT signaling in cancer is in colorectal cancer, where an activating mutation in a WNT pathway component is seen in 90% of sporadic cases. Inappropriate WNT pathway activation has also been implicated in most other solid human cancers but is not always associated with mutations in WNT pathway components (reviewed in Polakis, 2012).<br>Both tumor suppressors and oncogenes have been identified in the so-called canonical WNT pathway, which regulates WNT-dependent transcription by promoting the degradation of beta-catenin in the absence of ligand (reviewed in Polakis, 2012). Loss-of-function mutations in the destruction complex components APC, Axin and AMER1 and gain-of-function mutations in beta-catenin itself cause constitutive signaling and are found in cancers of the intestine, kidney, liver and stomach, among others (Polakis, 1995; Segiditsas and Tomlinson, 2006; Peifer and Polakis, 2000; Laurent-Puig et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2000; Satoh et al, 2000; Major et al, 2007; Ruteshouser et al, 2008). WNTs and WNT pathway components are also frequently over- or under-expressed in various cancers, and these changes are correlated with epigenetic regulation of promoter activity. In some contexts, both the canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling, which governs processes such as cell polarity and morphogenesis, may also contribute to tumor formation by promoting cell migration, invasiveness and metastasis." ;

                "Human NOTCH1 was cloned as a chromosome 9 gene, translocated to the T-cell beta receptor (TCBR) promoter on chromosome 7 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (Ellisen et al. 1991). This translocation, present in only a small percentage of T-ALL patients, results in the overexpression of a truncated NOTCH1 receptor, which lacks almost the entire extracellular domain, in T lymphocytes. Oncogenic NOTCH1 mutations were subsequently found to be present in >50% of T-ALL patients, with hotspots in the heterodimerization domain (HD domain) and PEST domain of NOTCH1 (Weng et al. 2004). <br><br>Normal NOTCH1 becomes activated by binding DLL (DLL1 or DLL4) or JAG (JAG1 or JAG2) ligands expressed on the surface of a neighboring cell, which leads to proteolytic cleavage of NOTCH1 by ADAM10/17 and gamma-secretase, and release of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) which regulates expression of genes that play important roles in the development of T lymphocytes (Washburn et al. 1997. Radtke et al. 1999, Maillard et al. 2004, Sambandam et al. 2005, Tan et al. 2005). Mutations in the HD domain, responsible for association of NOTCH1 extracellular and transmembrane regions after furin-mediated cleavage of NOTCH1 precursor, as well as the truncation of the NOTCH1 extracellular domain by the rare T-ALL translocation, enable constitutive production of NICD1, in the absence of ligand binding (Malecki et al. 2006, Ellisen et al. 1991).<br><br>Mutations in the NOTCH1 PEST domain interfere with FBXW7 (FBW7)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NICD1, resulting in prolonged half-life and increased transcriptional activity of NICD1, which promotes growth and division of T-lymphocytes (Weng et al. 2004, Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007).<br><br>Mutations in the HD domain and PEST domain of NOTCH1 are frequently found in cis in T-ALL. While HD mutations alone result in up to ~10-fold increase in NOTCH1 transcriptional activity and PEST domain mutations alone result in up to ~2-fold increase in NOTCH1 transcriptional activity, in cis mutations of HD and PEST domains act synergistically, increasing NOTCH1 transcriptional activity up to ~40-fold (Weng et al. 2004).<br><br>FBXW7 (FBW7), a component of the SCF (SKP1, CUL1, and F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-FBW7 involved in the degradation of NOTCH1 (Oberg et al. 2001, Wu et al. 2001, Fryer et al. 2004), is subject to loss of function mutations in T-ALL (Akhoondi et al. 2007, Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007) which are mutually exclusive with NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations (Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007).<br><br>Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are successfully used in vitro to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cell lines, the gamma-secretase complex has many other substrates besides NOTCH. The specificity of GSIs is therefore limited and, as they are not considered to be particularly promising drugs for the clinical treatment of T-ALL (reviewed by Purow, 2012), they have not been annotated.<br><br>For a recent review of NOTCH1 signaling in cancer, please refer to Grabher et al. 2006." ;

                "A number of skeletal and developmental diseases have been shown to arise as a result of mutations in the FGFR1, 2 and 3 genes. These include dwarfism syndromes (achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and the neonatal lethal disorders thanatophoric dysplasia I and II), as well as craniosynostosis disorders such as Pfeiffer, Apert, Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss and Muenke syndromes (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue 1997; Burke, 1998, Cunningham, 2007; Harada, 2009). These mutations fall into four general regions of the receptor: a) the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain II-III linker region, b) the alternatively spliced second half of the Ig III domain, c) the transmembrane domain and d) the tyrosine kinase domain (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997). With the exception of mutations in class b), which affect only the relevant splice variant, these mutations may be present in either the 'b' or 'c' isoforms. These activating mutations affect FGFR function by altering or expanding the ligand-binding range of the receptors (see for instance Ibrahimi, 2004a), by promoting ligand-independent dimerization (for instance, Galvin,1996; Neilson and Friesel, 1996; d'Avis,1998) or by increasing the activity of the kinase domain (for instance, Webster, 1996; Naski, 1996; Tavormina, 1999; Bellus, 2000). Thus, a number of the point mutations found in FGFR receptors alter their activity without altering their intrinsic kinase activity. Many of the mutations that promote constitutive dimerization do so by creating or removing cysteine residues; the presence of an unpaired cysteine in the receptor is believed to promote dimerization through the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds (Galvin, 1996; Robertson, 1998). Paralogous mutations at equivalent positions have been identified in more than one FGF receptor, sometimes giving rise to different diseases. For instance, mutation of the highly conserved FGFR2 Ser252-Pro253 dipeptide in the region between the second and third Ig domain is responsible for virtually all cases of Apert Syndrome (Wilkie, 1995), while paralogous mutations in FGFR1 (S252R) and FGFR3 (P250R) are associated with Pfeiffer and Crouzon syndromes, respectively (Bellus, 1996). FGFR4 is unique in that mutations of this gene are not known to be associated with any developmental disorders.<br><br>Recently, many of the same activating mutations in the FGFR genes that have been characterized in skeletal and developmental disorders have begun to be identified in a range of cancers (reviewed in Turner and Gross, 2010; Greulich and Pollock, 2011; Wesche, 2011). The best established link between a somatic mutation of an FGFR and the development of cancer is in the case of FGFR3, where 50% of bladder cancers have mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence. Of these mutations, which largely match the activating mutations seen in thanatophoric dysplasias, over half occur at a single residue (S249C) (Cappellen, 1999; van Rhijn, 2002). Activating mutations have also been identified in the coding sequences of FGFR1, 2 and 4 (for review, see Wesche, 2011)<br><br>In addition to activating point mutations, the FGFR1, 2 and 3 genes are subject to misregulation in cancer through gene amplification and translocation events, which are thought to lead to overexpression and ligand-independent dimerization (Weiss, 2010; Turner, 2010; Kunii, 2008; Takeda, 2007; Chesi, 1997; Avet-Loiseau, 1998; Ronchetti, 2001). It is important to note, however, that in each of these cases, the amplification or translocation involve large genomic regions encompassing additional genes, and the definitive roles of the FGFR genes in promoting oncogenesis has not been totally established. In the case of FGFR1, translocation events also give rise to FGFR1 fusion proteins that contain the intracellular kinase domain of the receptor fused to a dimerization domain from the partner gene. These fusions, which are expressed in a pre-leukemic myeloproliferative syndrome, dimerize constitutively based on the dimerization domain provided by the fusion partner and are constitutively active (reviewed in Jackson, 2010).<br><br>" ;

                "Diseases of glycosylation, usually referred to as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), are rare inherited disorders ascribing defects of nucleotide-sugar biosynthesis and transport, glycosyltransfer events and vesicular transport. Most CDGs cause neurological impairment ranging from severe psychomotor retardation to mild intellectual disability. Defects in N-glycosylation are the main cause of CDGs (Marquardt & Denecke 2003, Grunewald et al. 2002, Hennet 2012, Goreta et al. 2012) and can be identified by a characteristic abnormal isoelectric focusing profile of plasma transferrin (Jaeken et al. 1984, Stibler & Jaeken 1990). Disorders of O-glycosylation, glycosaminoglycan and glycolipid metabolism have recently been discovered and, together with N-glycosylation, represent the major pathways affected by glycan biosynthetic disorders (Freeze 2006, Jaeken 2011). As the number of these disorders has increased, nomenclature has been simplified so that now, the name of the mutant gene is followed by the abbreviation CDG (Jaeken et al. 2009). Effective therapies for most types of CDGs are so far not available (Thiel & Korner 2013)." ;

                "Signaling by the TGF-beta receptor complex is tumor suppressive, as it inhibits cell growth and promotes cell differentiation and apoptosis (Shipley et al. 1986, Hannon et al. 1994, Datto et al. 1995, Chen et al. 2002, Azar et al. 2009). TGF-beta signaling is frequently impaired in cancer, mostly through SMAD4 gene deletion or loss-of-function mutations, which are especially frequent in pancreatic cancer (Hahn et al. 1996, Shi et al. 1997, Fleming et al. 2013). Signaling by TGF-beta receptor complex can also be disrupted by loss-of-function mutations in SMAD2 and SMAD3 (Fleming et al. 2013) or loss-of-function mutations in TGFBR2 (TGF-beta receptor II) (Markowitz et al. 1995, Garrigue-Antar et al. 1995, Parsons et al. 1995, Grady et al. 1999) or TGFBR1 (TGF-beta receptor I) (Chen et al. 1998, Chen et al. 2001, Goudie et al. 2011).<br><br>In advanced cancer, signaling by TGF-beta may be tumor promoting, as it induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby increasing invasiveness (Cui et al. 1996, Guasch et al. 2007, reviewed by Heldin et al. 2012)." ;

                "The importance of the RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival is highlighted by the fact that components of the pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers. Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF. RAS pathway activation is also achieved in a smaller subset of cancers by loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of RAS signaling, such as the RAS GAP NF1(reviewed in Prior et al, 2012; Pylayeva-Gupta et al, 2011; Stephen et al, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015; Lito et al, 2013; Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Maertens and Cichowski, 2014)." ;

                "Defects in mammalian DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) are characterized by microsatellite instability and reduced fidelity during replication and repair steps. The MMR proteins interact with each other to execute steps within the mismatch repair pathway. Defective variants of these proteins are associated with nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The MutS proteins are thought to directly contact double-stranded DNA, scanning along the genomic DNA for mismatches analogous to a \"sliding clamp\" until they encounter a base pair containing a mismatch. The MutS proteins interact with multiple proteins including other MLH and MutL, the later have significant amino acid identify and structural similarity to the MLH proteins, as well as RPA, EXO1, RFC, possibly HMGB1, and other less well-characterized proteins. <br> <br> With respect to the mutator function, the MSH2/MutSaplha heterodimer is thought primarily to repair single-base substitutions and 1 bp insertiondeletion mutations, while MSH2/MutSbeta is thought primarily to repair 1-4 bp insertiondeletion mutations. The MLH and MutL heterodimer proteins interact with heterodimers of MutS proteins to help catalyze different functions. MLH1:MutLalpha is the primary complex that interacts with both MutS alpha and beta complex in mechanisms thought to be relevant to cancer prevention. Recent studies suggest that MLH1:MLH3 may also contributes to some of these processes as well, but in all mechanisms tested to a lesser degree than MLH1:PMS2." ;

                "Hh signaling is required for a number of developmental processes, and mutations that disrupt the normal processing and biogenesis of Hh ligand can result in neonatal abnormalities. SHH is one of a number of genes that have been associated with the congenital disorder holoprosencephaly, which causes abnormalities in brain and craniofacial development (Roessler et al, 2009; reviewed in Roessler and Muenke, 2011). SHH variants associated with the condition affect the autocatalytic processing of the precursor and dramatically impair the production of the secreted active Hh-Np, abrogating signaling (reviewed in Pan et al, 2013). Aberrant Hh signaling is also associated with gondal dysgenesis syndromes in which palmitoylation of DHH is abrogated by mutation of the acyltransferase HHAT (Callier et al, 2014)." ;

                "Class IA PI3K is a heterodimer of a p85 regulatory subunit (encoded by PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3) and a p110 catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA, PIK3CB or PIK3CD). In the absence of activating signals, the regulatory subunit stabilizes the catalytic subunit while inhibiting its activity. The complex becomes activated when extracellular signals stimulate the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors or receptor-associated proteins. The p85 regulatory subunit binds phosphorylated motifs of activator proteins, which induces a conformational change that relieves p85-mediated inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit and enables PI3K to phosphorylate PIP2 to form PIP3. The phosphoinositide kinase activity of PI3K is opposed by the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN. <br><br>PIP3 acts as a messenger that recruits PDPK1 (PDK1) and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3) to the plasma membrane. PDPK1 also possesses a low affinity for PIP2, so small amounts of PDPK1 are always present at the membrane. Binding of AKT to PIP3 induces a conformational change that enables TORC2 complex to phosphorylate AKT at a conserved serine residue (S473 in AKT1). Phosphorylation at the serine residue enables AKT to bind to PDPK1 and exposes a conserved threonine residue (T308) that is phosphorylated by PDPK1. AKT phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues dissociates from the plasma membrane and acts as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear targets involved in regulation of cell metabolism, survival and gene expression. For a recent review, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007. <br> Signaling by PI3K/AKT is frequently constitutively activated in cancer. This activation can be via gain-of-function mutations in PI3KCA (encoding catalytic subunit p110alpha), PIK3R1 (encoding regulatory subunit p85alpha) and AKT1. The PI3K/AKT pathway can also be constitutively activated by loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN. <br> Gain-of-function mutations activate PI3K signaling by diverse mechanisms. Mutations affecting the helical domain of PIK3CA and mutations affecting nSH2 and iSH2 domains of PIK3R1 impair inhibitory interactions between these two subunits while preserving their association. Mutations in the catalytic domain of PIK3CA enable the kinase to achieve an active conformation. PI3K complexes with gain-of-function mutations therefore produce PIP3 and activate downstream AKT in the absence of growth factors (Huang et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2005, Miled et al. 2007, Horn et al. 2008, Sun et al. 2010, Jaiswal et al. 2009, Zhao and Vogt 2010, Urick et al. 2011). While AKT1 gene copy number, expression level and phosphorylation are often increased in cancer, only one low frequency point mutation has been repeatedly reported in cancer and functionally studied. This mutation represents a substitution of a glutamic acid residue with lysine at position 17 of AKT1, and acts by enabling AKT1 to bind PIP2. PIP2-bound AKT1 is phosphorylated by TORC2 complex and by PDPK1 that is always present at the plasma membrane, due to low affinity for PIP2. Therefore, E17K substitution abrogates the need for PI3K in AKT1 activation (Carpten et al. 2007, Landgraf et al. 2008). <br> Loss-of-function mutations affecting the phosphatase domain of PTEN are frequently found in sporadic cancers (Kong et al. 1997, Lee et al. 1999, Han et al. 2000), as well as in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) (Marsh et al. 1998). PTEN can also be inactivated by gene deletion or epigenetic silencing, or indirectly by overexpression of microRNAs that target PTEN mRNA (Huse et al. 2009). Cells with deficient PTEN function have increased levels of PIP3, and therefore increased AKT activity. For a recent review, please refer to Hollander et al. 2011.<br> Because of their clear involvement in human cancers, PI3K and AKT are targets of considerable interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors. Although none of the currently available inhibitors display preference for mutant variants of PIK3CA or AKT, several inhibitors targeting the wild-type kinases are undergoing clinical trials. These include dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, class I PI3K inhibitors, pan-PI3K inhibitors, and pan-AKT inhibitors. While none have yet been approved for clinical use, these agents show promise for future therapeutics. In addition, isoform-specific PI3K and AKT inhibitors are currently being developed, and may provide more specific treatments along with reduced side-effects. For a recent review, please refer to Liu et al. 2009." ;

                "Biological processes are captured in Reactome by identifying the molecules (DNA, RNA, protein, small molecules) involved in them and describing the details of their interactions. From this molecular viewpoint, human disease pathways have three mechanistic causes: the inclusion of microbially-expressed proteins, altered functions of human proteins, or changed expression levels of otherwise functionally normal human proteins.<p>The first group encompasses the infectious diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis and HIV infection. The second group involves human proteins modified either by a mutation or by an abnormal post-translational event that produces an aberrant protein with a novel function. Examples include somatic mutations of EGFR and FGFR (epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptor) genes, which encode constitutively active receptors that signal even in the absence of their ligands, or the somatic mutation of IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) that leads to an enzyme active on 2-oxoglutarate rather than isocitrate, or the abnormal protein aggregations of amyloidosis which lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's.<p>Infectious diseases are represented in Reactome as microbial-human protein interactions and the consequent events. The existence of variant proteins and their association with disease-specific biological processes is represented by inclusion of the modified protein in a new or variant reaction, an extension to the 'normal' pathway. Diseases which result from proteins performing their normal functions but at abnormal rates can also be captured, though less directly. Many mutant alleles encode proteins that retain their normal functions but have abnormal stabilities or catalytic efficiencies, leading to normal reactions that proceed to abnormal extents. The phenotypes of such diseases can be revealed when pathway annotations are combined with expression or rate data from other sources." ;

                "The immune system is a complex network of the biological processes that provide defense mechanisms during infection or in response to an intrinsic danger signal. Compromised immune response may present itself as either overactivity or underactivity of the immune system leading to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that can be categorized into four main groups - autoimmunity, immunodeficiency (ID) with a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, hypersensitivity to compounds that are usually not harmful and malignancy. Several host conditions may cause the dysfunctional immunity. Among them are inherited and somatic mutations found in the components of immune signaling pathways. In addition to genetic defects, infection with pathogen such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or interaction of immune cells with immunosuppressive drugs result in non-genetic immunodeficiencies. Age-associated alterations in immunity may also contribute to pathogenesis of immunodeficiency .<p>The Reactome module represents selected defects of the immune system and provides a short description of their clinical phenotypes. The module also describes functional features of defective molecules by both providing a published source for experimental functional analysis data and linking to the corresponding normal process within the Reactome database." ;
