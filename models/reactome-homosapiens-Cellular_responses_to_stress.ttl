                "Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2.-), peroxides (ROOR), singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH.) are generated by cellular processes such as respiration (reviewed in Murphy 2009, Brand 2010) and redox enzymes and are required for signaling yet they are damaging due to their high reactivity (reviewed in Imlay 2008, Buettner 2011, Kavdia 2011, Birben et al. 2012, Ray et al. 2012). Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011). Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.<br>Humans contain 3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends to remain in the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013)." ;

                "Though metals such as zinc, copper, and iron are required as cofactors for cellular enzymes they can also catalyze damaging metal substitution or unspecific redox reactions if they are not sequestered. The transcription factor MTF1 directs the major cellular response to zinc, cadmium, and copper. MTF1 activates gene expression to up-regulate genes encoding proteins, such as metallothioneins and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), involved in sequestering metals. MTF1 represses gene expression to down-regulate genes encoding transporters that import the metals into the cell (reviewed in Laity and Andrews 2007, Jackson et al. 2008, Günther et al. 2012, Dong et al. 2015). During activation MTF1 in the cytosol binds zinc ions and is translocated into the nucleus, where it binds metal response elements in the promoters of target genes. Activation of MTF1 by cadmium and copper appears to be indirect as these metals displace zinc from metallothioneins and the displaced zinc then binds MTF1.<br>Metallothioneins bind metals and participate in detoxifying heavy metals, storing and transporting zinc, and redox biochemistry." ;

Appropriate responses to these signals are essential for normal development, maintenance of homeostasis in mature tissues, and effective defensive responses to potentially noxious agents (Kultz 2005). It is convenient, if somewhat arbitrary, to distinguish responses to signals involved in development and homeostasis from ones involved in stress responses, and that classification is followed here, with <b>macroautophagy</b> and <b>responses to metal ions</b> classified as responses to normal external stimuli, while responses to hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, and heat, and the process of cellular senescence are classified as <b>stress responses</b>.

                "Cellular senescence involves irreversible growth arrest accompanied by phenotypic changes such as enlarged morphology, reorganization of chromatin through formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), and changes in gene expression that result in secretion of a number of proteins that alter local tissue environment, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).<br><br>Senescence is considered to be a cancer protective mechanism and is also involved in aging. Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues (reviewed by Campisi 1997 and Lopez-Otin 2013), which may be due to an increased senescence rate and/or decrease in the rate of clearance of senescent cells. In a mouse model of accelerated aging, clearance of senescent cells delays the onset of age-related phenotypes (Baker et al. 2011).<p>Cellular senescence can be triggered by the aberrant activation of oncogenes or loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes, and this type of senescence is known as the oncogene-induced senescence, with RAS signaling-induced senescence being the best studied. Oxidative stress, which may or may not be caused by oncogenic RAS signaling, can also trigger senescence. Finally, the cellular senescence program can be initiated by DNA damage, which may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress, and by telomere shortening caused by replicative exhaustion which may be due to oncogenic signaling. The senescent phenotype was first reported by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961, when they proposed replicative senescence as a mechanism responsible for the cessation of mitotic activity and morphological changes that occur in human somatic diploid cell strains as a consequence of serial passaging, preventing the continuous culture of untransformed cells-the Hayflick limit (Hayflick and Moorhead 1961).<p> Secreted proteins that constitute the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS), include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines, growth factors, shed cell surface molecules and survival factors. The SASP profile is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger or the cell type (Coppe et al. 2008), but the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008).<p>Senescent cells may remain viable for years, such as senescent melanocytes of moles and nevi, or they can be removed by phagocytic cells. The standard marker for immunohistochemical detection of senescent cells is senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal), a lysosomal enzyme that is not required for senescence.<p>For reviews of this topic, please refer to Collado et al. 2007, Adams 2009, Kuilman et al. 2010. For a review of differential gene expression between senescent and immortalized cells, please refer to Fridman and Tainsky 2008." ;

                "Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are transcription factors that become activated upon sensing steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, or estrogen (Escriva et al 2000; Griekspoor A et al. 2007; Eick GN & Thornton JW. 2011). Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (Hernández MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic functions in the cytoplasm.<p>The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs." ;

                "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) acts as a buffer against starvation by liberating building materials and energy sources from cellular components. It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, for example, Crohn's disease, cancer and neurodegeneration (Ravikumar et al. 2010).<br>Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans; much of the machinery was first identified in yeast (see Klionsky et al. 2011). Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped structures called the isolation membrane or phagophore engulf portions of cytoplasm. The membranes fuse to form the autophagosome. In yeast cells, autophagosomes are formed at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) next to the vacuole. In mammals, autophagosomes appear throughout the cytoplasm then move along microtubules towards the microtubule-organising centre. This transport requires microtubules and the function of dynein motor proteins; depolymerization of microtubules or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport results in inhibition of autophagy (Kochl et al. 2006, Kimura et al. 2008). Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Mizushima et al. 2011).<br><br>The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes have all been implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane (Lamb et al. 2013). Recently 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes has shown the cup-shaped isolation membrane tightly sandwiched between two sheets of ER and physically connected to the ER through a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009). This suggests that isolation membrane formation and elongation are guided by adjacent ER sheets, supporting the now prevalent 'ER cradle' model, which suggests that the isolation membrane arises from the ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>Autophagy is tightly regulated. The induction of autophagy in response to starvation is partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Noda & Ohsumi 1998) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while energy loss induces autophagy by activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Other pathways regulating autophagy are regulated by calcium, cyclic AMP, calpains and the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (Rubinsztein et al. 2012). <br><br>In mammals, two complexes cooperatively produce the isolation membrane. The ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, ATG13, (FIP200) and ATG101 (Alers et al. 2012). The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009). The ULK and Beclin-1 complexes are recruited to specific autophagosome nucleation regions where they stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) production and facilitate the elongation and initial membrane curvature of the phagophore membrane (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).<br><br>The ULK complex is considered the most upstream component of the mammalian autophagy pathway (Itakura & Mizushima 2010), acting as an integrator of the autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. It is not fully understood how ULK1 is modulated in response to environmental cues. Phosphorylation plays an essential role (Dunlop & Tee 2013) but it is not clear how phosphorylation regulates ULK1 activities (Ravikumar et al. 2010). ULK1 kinase activity is required for autophagy, but the substrate(s) of ULK1 that mediate its autophagic function are not certain. ULK1 may also have kinase-independent functions in autophagy (Wong et al. 2013). <br><br> PIK3C3 (Vps34) is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that produces PI3P. It is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). BECN1 binds several further proteins that affect autophagosome formation. Partners that induce autophagy include AMBRA1 (Fimia et al. 2007), UVRAG (Liang et al. 2006) and SH3GLB1 (Takahashi et al. 2007). Binding of BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) inhibit autophagy (Pattingre et al. 2005, Ciechomska et al. 2009). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor complex that binds BCL2 also interacts with BECN1, inhibiting autophagy (Vincencio et al. 2009). CISD2 (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1, NAF1), a component in the IP3R complex, interacts with BCL2 at the ER and stabilizes the BCL2-BECN1 interaction (Chang et al. 2010). Starvation leads to activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), which results in the phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCL2L1, which release their binding to BECN1 and thus induces autophagosome formation (Wei et al. 2008). <br><br>AMBRA1 can simultaneously bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex. During nutrient starvation, AMBRA1 is phosphorylated in a ULK1-dependent manner (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). This phosphorylation releases AMBRA1-associated Beclin-1 complexes from dynein and the microtubule network, freeing the complex to translocate to autophagy initiation sites (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). <br><br>A characteristic of this early phase of autophagosome formation is the formation of PI3P-enriched ER-associated structures called omegasomes (Axe et al. 2008) or cradles (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009). Omegasomes appear to concentrate at or near the connected mitochondria-associated ER membrane (Hamasaki et al. 2013). However, the phagophore also can incorporate existing material from other membrane sources such as ER exit sites (ERES), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). Omegasomes lead to the formation of the isolation membrane or phagophore, which is thought to form de novo by an unknown mechanism (Simonsen & Stenmark 2008, Roberts & Ktistakis 2013). Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes and semi-autonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>ATG9 is a direct target of ULK1. In nutrient-rich conditions mammalian ATG9 is localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (including early, late and recycling endosomes), whereas under starvation conditions it is localized to autophagosomes, in a process that is dependent on ULK1 (Young et al. 2006). ATG9 is believed to play a role in the delivery of vesicles derived from existing membranes to the expanding phagophore (Lamb et al. 2013). Yeast Atg9 forms a complex with Atg2 and Atg18 (Reggiori et al. 2004). <br><br>PI3P produced at the initiation site is sensed by WIPI2b, the mammalian homologue of Atg18 (Polson et al. 2010). WIPI2b then recruits Atg16L1 (Dooley et al. 2014). There are four WIPI proteins in mammalian cells (Proikas-Cezanne et al. 2015). They are all likely bind PI3P and be recruited to membranes but the function of WIPI1, 3 and 4 in autophagy is not yet clear. WIPI4 (WDR45) has been shown to bind Atg2 and to be involved in lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al. 2012); mutations in WIPI4 have been shown to cause a neurodegenerative disease (Saitsu et al. 2013).<br><br>The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions. First, the ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7, which acts as an E1-like activating enzyme, and ATG10, which has a role similar to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ATG5:ATG12 complex then interacts non-covalently with ATG16L1. This complex associates with the forming autophagosome but dissociates from completed autophagosomes (Geng & Klionski 2008). The second ubiquitin-like reaction involves the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules of the LC3 family (Weidberg et al. 2010). LC3 proteins are conjugated through their C-terminal glycine residues with PE by the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG3. This allows LC3 proteins to associate with the autophagosome membrane. <br><br>The ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L1 complex (Mizushima et al., 2011) acts as an E3 like enzyme for the conjugation of LC3 family proteins (mammalian homologues of yeast Atg8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008). LC3 PE can be deconjugated by the protease ATG4 (Li et al. 2011, 2012). ATG4 is also responsible for priming LC3 proteins by cleaving the C terminus to expose a glycine residue (Kirisako et al, 2000, Scherz Shouval et al. 2007). LC3 proteins remain associated with autophagosomes until they fuse with lysosomes. The LC3-like proteins inside the resulting autolysosomes are degraded, while those on the cytoplasmic surface are delipidated and recycled. ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-negative vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures (pre-phagophores and possibly early phagophores), ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-positive structures can be considered to be phagophores, and ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-negative LC3-positive vesicles can be regarded as mature autophagosomes (Tandia et al. 2011).<br><br>Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes as well as from semiautonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>The mechanisms involved in the closure of the phagophore membrane are poorly understood. As the phagophore is a double-membraned structure, its closure involves the fusion of a narrow opening, a process that is distinct from other membrane fusion events (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The topology of the phagophore is similar to that of cytokinesis, viral budding or multivesicular body (MVB) formation. These processes rely on the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) (Rusten et al. 2012). ESCRT and associated proteins facilitate membrane budding away from the cytosol and subsequent cleavage of the bud neck (Hurley & Hanson 2010). Several studies have shown that depletion of ESCRT subunits or the regulatory ATPase Vps4 causes an accumulation of autophagosomes (Filimonenko et al. 2007, Rusten et al. 2007) but it is not clear whether ESCRTs are required for autophagosome closure or for autophagosome to endosome fusion. UVRAG is also involved in the maturation step, recruiting proteins that bring about membrane fusion such as the class C Vps proteins, which activate Rab7 thereby promoting fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes (Liang et al. 2008)." ;

                "In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective mechanisms known collectively as \"heat shock response\". Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007; Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002; Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes." ;
