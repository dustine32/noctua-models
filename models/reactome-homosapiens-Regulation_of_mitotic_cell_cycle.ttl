                "The events of replication of the genome and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells make up the cell cycle. DNA replication is carried out during a discrete temporal period known as the S (synthesis)-phase, and chromosome segregation occurs during a massive reorganization of cellular architecture at mitosis. Two gap-phases separate these cell cycle events: G1 between mitosis and S-phase, and G2 between S-phase and mitosis. Cells can exit the cell cycle for a period and enter a quiescent state known as G0, or terminally differentiate into cells that will not divide again, but undergo morphological development to carry out the wide variety of specialized functions of individual tissues.<p>A family of protein serine/threonine kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) controls progression through the cell cycle. As the name suggests, the kinase activity of the catalytic subunits is dependent on binding to cyclin partners, and control of cyclin abundance is one of several mechanisms by which CDK activity is regulated throughout the cell cycle. <p>A complex network of regulatory processes determines whether a quiescent cell (in G0 or early G1) will leave this state and initiate the processes to replicate its chromosomal DNA and divide. This regulation, during the <b>Mitotic G1-G1/S phases</b> of the cell cycle, centers on transcriptional regulation by the DREAM complex, with major roles for D and E type cyclin proteins.<p>Chromosomal DNA synthesis occurs in the <b>S phase</b>, or the synthesis phase, of the cell cycle. The cell duplicates its hereditary material, and two copies of each chromosome are formed. A key aspect of the <b>regulation of DNA</b> replication is the assembly and modification of a pre-replication complex assembled on ORC proteins.<p><b>Mitotic G2-G2/M phases</b> encompass the interval between the completion of DNA synthesis and the beginning of mitosis. During G2, the cytoplasmic content of the cell increases. At G2/M transition, duplicated centrosomes mature and separate and CDK1:cyclin B complexes become active, setting the stage for spindle assembly and chromosome condensation at the start of mitotic <b>M phase</b>. Mitosis, or M phase, results in the generation of two daughter cells each with a complete diploid set of chromosomes. Events of the <b>M/G1 transition</b>, progression out of mitosis and division of the cell into two daughters (cytokinesis) are regulated by the Anaphase Promoting Complex.<p>The Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C) plays additional roles in <b>regulation of the mitotic cell cycle</b>, insuring the appropriate length of the G1 phase. The APC/C itself is regulated by phosphorylation and interactions with checkpoint proteins." ;

                "The Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C) functions during mitosis to promote sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit through the degradation of mitotic cyclins and securin. This complex is also active in interphase insuring the appropriate length of the G1 phase (reviewed in Peters, 2002). The APC/C contains at least 12 subunits and functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) promoting the multiubiquitination of its target proteins (see Gieffers et al., 2001). <br>In the ubiquitination reaction, ubiquitin is activated by the formation of a thioester bond with the (E1) ubiquitin activating enzyme then transferred to a cysteine residue within the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and ultimately to a lysine residue within the target protein, with the aid of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the APC/C. The ubiquitin chains generated are believed to target proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome (Reviewed in Peters, 1994 ) <br>The activity of the APC/C is highly periodic during the cell cycle and is controlled by a combination of regulatory events. The APC/C is activated by phosphorylation and the regulated recruitment of activating subunits and is negatively regulated by sequestration by kinetochore-associated checkpoint proteins. The Emi1 protein associates with Cdh1 and Cdc20, inhibiting the APC/C between G1/S and prophase. RSSA1 may play a similar role in ihibiting the APC during early mitosis.<br>Following phosphorylation of the APC/C core subunits by mitotic kinases, the activating subunit, Cdc20 is recruited to the APC/C and is responsible for mitotic activities, including the initiation of sister chromatid separation and the timing of exit from mitosis (See Zachariae and Nasmyth, 1999). Substrates of the Cdc20:APC/C complex, which are recognized by a motif known as the destruction box (D box) include Cyclin A, Nek2, Securin and Cyclin B. Degradation of Securin and Cyclin B does not occur until the mitotic spindle checkpoint has been satisfied (see Castro et al. 2005).<br>Cdc20 is degraded late in mitosis (Reviewed in Owens and Hoyt, 2005). At this time the activating subunit, Cdh1, previously maintained in an inactive phosphorylated state by mitotic kinases, is dephosphorylated and associates with and activates the APC/C. The APC/C:Cdh1 complex recognizes substrates containing a D box, a KEN box (Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000) or a D box activated (DAD) domain (Castro et al., 2002) sequence and promotes the ordered degration of mitotic cyclins and other mitotic proteins culminating with its own ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) subunit UbcH10 (Rape et al., 2006). This ordered degradation promotes the stability of Cyclin A at the end of G1. This stabilization, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation of Cdh1 and its abrupt dissociation from the APC/C, allowing accumulation of cyclins for the next G1/S transition (Sorensen et al., 2001). <br><br>" ;

                "Mitotic G1-G1/S phase involves G1 phase of the mitotic interphase and G1/S transition, when a cell commits to DNA replication and divison genetic and cellular material to two daughter cells.<p>During early G1, cells can enter a quiescent G0 state. In quiescent cells, the evolutionarily conserved DREAM complex, consisting of the pocket protein family member p130 (RBL2), bound to E2F4 or E2F5, and the MuvB complex, represses transcription of cell cycle genes (reviewed by Sadasivam and DeCaprio 2013).<p>During early G1 phase in actively cycling cells, transcription of cell cycle genes is repressed by another pocket protein family member, p107 (RBL1), which forms a complex with E2F4 (Ferreira et al. 1998, Cobrinik 2005). RB1 tumor suppressor, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, is the third member of the pocket protein family. RB1 binds to E2F transcription factors E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 and inhibits their transcriptional activity, resulting in prevention of G1/S transition (Chellappan et al. 1991, Bagchi et al. 1991, Chittenden et al. 1991, Lees et al. 1993, Hiebert 1993, Wu et al. 2001). Once RB1 is phosphorylated on serine residue S795 by Cyclin D:CDK4/6 complexes, it can no longer associate with and inhibit E2F1-3. Thus, CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of RB1 leads to transcriptional activation of E2F1-3 target genes needed for the S phase of the cell cycle (Connell-Crowley et al. 1997). CDK2, in complex with cyclin E, contributes to RB1 inactivation and also activates proteins needed for the initiation of DNA replication (Zhang 2007). Expression of D type cyclins is regulated by extracellular mitogens (Cheng et al. 1998, Depoortere et al. 1998). Catalytic activities of CDK4/6 and CDK2 are controlled by CDK inhibitors of the INK4 family (Serrano et al. 1993, Hannon and Beach 1994, Guan et al. 1994, Guan et al. 1996, Parry et al. 1995) and the Cip/Kip family, respectively." ;

                "Mitosis, or the M phase, involves nuclear division and cytokinesis, where two identical daughter cells are produced. Mitosis involves prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Finally, cytokinesis leads to cell division. The phase between two M phases is called the interphase; it encompasses the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle." ;
