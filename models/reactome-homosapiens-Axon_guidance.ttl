                "Netrins are secreted proteins that play a crucial role in neuronal migration and in axon guidance during the development of the nervous system. To date, several Netrins have been described in mouse and humans: Netrin-1, -3/NTL2, -4/h and G-Netrins. Netrin-1 is the most studied member of the family and has been shown to play a crucial role in neuronal navigation during nervous system development mainly through its interaction with its receptors DCC and UNC5. Members of the Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) family- which includes DCC and Neogenin in vertebrates- mediate netrin-induced axon attraction, whereas the C. elegans UNC5 receptor and its four vertebrate homologs Unc5a-Unc5d mediate repulsion." ;

                "Hox genes encode proteins that contain the DNA-binding homeobox motif and control early patterning of segments in the embryo as well as later events in development (reviewed in Rezsohazy et al. 2015). Mammals have 39 Hox genes arrayed in 4 linear clusters, with each cluster containing 9 to 11 genes. Based on homologies, the genes have been assigned to 13 paralogous groups. The nomenclature of Hox genes uses a letter to indicate the cluster and a number to indicate the paralog group. For example, HOXA4 is the gene in cluster A that is most similar with genes of paralog group 4 from other clusters. <br>One of the most striking aspects of mammalian Hox gene function is the mechanism of their activation during embryogenesis: the order of genes in a cluster correlates with the timing and location of their activation such that genes at the 3' end of a cluster are activated first and genes at the 5' end of a cluster are activated last. (5' and 3' refer to the transcriptional orientation of the genes in the cluster.) Because development of segments of the embryo proceeds from anterior to posterior this means that the anterior boundaries of expression of 3' genes are more anterior (rostral) and the anterior boundaries of expression of 5' genes are more posterior (caudal). Expression of HOX genes initiates in the posterior primitive streak at the beginning of gastrulation at approximately E7.5 in mouse. As gastrulation proceeds, further 5' genes are sequentially activated and they too undergo the same chromatin changes and migration. After formation of the axis of the embryo, similar waves of activation of HOXA and HOXD clusters occur in developing limbs beginning at about E9. Retinoids, especially all trans retinoic acid (atRA), participate in initiating the process via retinoid receptors. Other factors such as FGFs and Wnt, also regulate Hox expression. After activation, Hox genes participate in maintaining their own expression (autoregulation), activating later, 5' Hox genes, and repressing prior, 3' Hox genes (crossregulation). Differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells in response to retinoic acid is used to model the process in vitro (reviewed in Gudas et al. 2013). <br>Activation of Hox genes is accompanied by a change from bivalent chromatin to euchromatin (reviewed in Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). Bivalent chromatin has extensive methylation of lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), a repressive mark, with interspersed punctate regions of methylation of lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2, H3K4me3), an activating mark. Euchromatization initiates at the 3' ends of clusters and proceeds towards the 5' ends, with the euchromatin migrating to an active region of the nucleus (reviewed in Montavon and Duboule 2013). This change in chromatin reflects a loss of H3K27me3 and a gain of H3K4me2,3. Polycomb repressive complexes bind H3K27me3 and are responsible for maintenance of repression, KDM6A and KDM6B histone demethylases remove H3K27me3, and members of the trithorax family of histone methylases (KMT2A, KMT2C, KMT2D) methylate H3K4." ;

                "The normal development of the pancreas during gestation has been intensively investigated over the past decade especially in the mouse (Servitja and Ferrer 2004; Chakrabarti and Mirmira 2003). Studies of genetic defects associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has provided direct insight into these processes as they take place in humans (Fajans et al. 2001). During embryogenesis, committed epithelial cells from the early pancreatic buds differentiate into mature endocrine and exocrine cells. It is helpful to schematize this process into four consecutive cellular stages, to begin to describe the complex interplay of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional networks. The annotations here are by no means complete - factors in addition to the ones described here must be active, and even for the ones that are described, only key examples of their regulatory effects and interactions have been annotated.<p>It is also important to realize that in the human, unlike the mouse, cells of the different stages can be present simultaneously in the developing pancreas and the linear representation of these developmental events shown here is an over-simplification of the actual developmental process (e.g., Sarkar et al. 2008).<p>The first stage of this process involves the predifferentiated epithelial cells of the two pancreatic anlagen that arise from the definitive endoderm at approximately somite stages 11-15 and undergo budding from somite stages 20-22. This period corresponds to gestational days 8.75-9.5 in the mouse, and 26 in the human.<p>Pancreatic buds subsequently coalesce to form a single primitive gland, while concomitantly a ductal tree lined by highly proliferative epithelial cells is formed. A subset of such epithelial cells is thought to differentiate into either endocrine or acinar exocrine cells. A third cellular stage is defined by the endocrine-committed progenitors that selectively express the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NEUROG3. NEUROG3 is known to activate a complex transcriptional network that is essential for the specification of endocrine cells. Many transcription factors that are activated by NEUROG3 are also involved in islet-subtype cellular specification and in subsequent stages of differentiation of endocrine cells. This transient cellular stage thus leads to the generation of all known pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing beta-cells, and glucagon-producing alpha cells, the final stage of this schematic developmental process.<p>The diagram below summarizes interactions that take place between transcription factors and transcription factor target genes during these cellular stages, and shows cases where there is both functional evidence that a transcription factor is required for the target gene to be expressed, and biochemical evidence that this interaction is direct. We also describe instances where a signaling pathway is known to regulate a transcription factor gene in this process, even if the intervening signaling pathway is not fully understood." ;

                "The Roundabout (ROBO) family encodes transmembrane receptors that regulate axonal guidance and cell migration. The major function of the Robo receptors is to mediate repulsion of the navigating growth cones. There are four human Robo homologues, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and ROBO4. Most of the ROBOs have the similar ectodomain architecture as the cell adhesion molecules, with five Ig domains followed by three FN3 repeats, except for ROBO4. ROBO4 has two Ig and two FN3 repeats. The cytoplasmic domains of ROBO receptors are in general poorly conserved. However, there are four short conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs, named CC0-3, that serve as binding sites for adaptor proteins. The ligands for the human ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are the three SLIT proteins SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3; all of the SLIT proteins contain a tandem of four LRR (leucine rich repeat) domains at the N-terminus, termed D1-D4, followed by six EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, a laminin G like domain (ALPS), three EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain. Most SLIT proteins are cleaved within the EGF-like region by unknown proteases (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). NELL2 is a ligand for ROBO3 (Jaworski et al. 2015).<br><br>SLIT protein binding modulates ROBO interactions with the cytosolic adaptors. The cytoplasmic domain of ROBO1 and ROBO2 determines the repulsive responses of these receptors. Based on the studies from both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms it has been inferred that ROBO induces growth cone repulsion by controlling cytoskeletal dynamics via either Abelson kinase (ABL) and Enabled (Ena), or RAC1 activity (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). While there is some redundancy in the function of ROBO receptors, ROBO1 is implicated as the predominant receptor for axon guidance in ventral tracts, and ROBO2 is the predominant receptor for axon guidance in dorsal tracts. ROBO2 also repels neuron cell bodies from the floor plate (Kim et al. 2011).<p>In addition to regulating axon guidance, ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are also implicated in regulation of proliferation and transition of primary to intermediate neuronal progenitors through a poorly characterized cross-talk with NOTCH-mediated activation of HES1 transcription (Borrell et al. 2012).<p>Thalamocortical axon extension is regulated by neuronal activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of ROBO1 transcription. Lower neuronal activity correlates with increased ROBO1 transcription, possibly mediated by the NFKB complex (Mire et al. 2012).<p>It is suggested that the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.9 stimulates transcription of ROBO2, which is involved in regulation of motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal code (Bravo-Ambrosio et al. 2012).<p>Of the four ROBO proteins, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal system development but is, instead, involved in angiogenesis. The interaction of ROBO4 with SLIT3 is involved in proliferation, motility and chemotaxis of endothelial cells, and accelerates formation of blood vessels (Zhang et al. 2009)." ;

                "The neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM, is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and is involved in a variety of cellular processes of importance for the formation and maintenance of the nervous system. The role of NCAM in neural differentiation and synaptic plasticity is presumed to depend on the modulation of intracellular signal transduction cascades. NCAM based signaling complexes can initiate downstream intracellular signals by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation of FGFR and (2) formation of intracellular signaling complexes by direct interaction with cytoplasmic interaction partners such as Fyn and FAK. Tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK interact with NCAM and undergo phosphorylation and this transiently activates the MAPK, ERK 1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB. CREB activates transcription of genes which are important for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity in neurons.<br><br>NCAM1 mediated intracellular signal transduction is represented in the figure below. The Ig domains in NCAM1 are represented in orange ovals and Fn domains in green squares. The tyrosine residues susceptible to phosphorylation are represented in red circles and their positions are numbered. Phosphorylation is represented by red arrows and dephosphorylation by yellow.

                "Pluripotent stem cells are undifferentiated cells posessing an abbreviated cell cycle (reviewed in Stein et al. 2012), a characteristic profile of gene expression (Rao et al. 2004, Kim et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Wang et al 2006 using mouse, International Stem Cell Initiative 2007, Assou et al. 2007, Assou et al. 2009, Ding et al. 2012 using mouse), and the ability to self-renew and generate all cell types of the body except extraembryonic lineages (Marti et al. 2013, reviewed in Romeo et al. 2012). They are a major cell type in the inner cell mass of the early embryo in vivo, and cells with the same properties, induced pluripotent stem cells, can be generated in vitro from differentiated adult cells by overexpression of a set of transcription factor genes (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006, Takahashi et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Jaenisch and Young 2008, Stein et al. 2012, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012).<br>Pluripotency is maintained by a self-reinforcing loop of transcription factors (Boyer et al. 2005, Rao et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Sun et al. 2008, Assou et al. 2009, reviewed in Kashyap et al. 2009, reviewed in Dejosez and Zwaka 2012). In vivo, initiation of pluripotency may depend on maternal factors transmitted through the oocyte (Assou et al. 2009) and on DNA demethylation in the zygote (recently reviewed in Seisenberger et al. 2013) and hypoxia experienced by the blastocyst in the reproductive tract before implantation (Forristal et al. 2010, reviewed in Mohyeldin et al. 2010). In vitro, induced pluripotency may initiate with demethylation and activation of the promoters of POU5F1 (OCT4) and NANOG (Bhutani et al. 2010). Hypoxia also significantly enhances conversion to pluripotent stem cells (Yoshida et al. 2009). POU5F1 and NANOG, together with SOX2, encode central factors in pluripotency and activate their own transcription (Boyer et al 2005, Babaie et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2007, Takahashi et al. 2007). The autoactivation loop maintains expression of POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 at high levels in stem cells and, in turn, complexes containing various combinations of these factors (Remenyi et al. 2003, Lam et al. 2012) activate the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with rapid cell proliferation and repress the expression of a group of genes whose products are associated with cell differentiation (Boyer et al. 2005, Matoba et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Forristal et al. 2010, Guenther 2011).<br>Comparisons between human and mouse embryonic stem cells must be made with caution and for this reason inferences from mouse have been used sparingly in this module. Human ESCs more closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells in having inactivated X chromosomes, flattened morphology, and intolerance to passaging as single cells (Hanna et al. 2010). Molecularly, human ESCs differ from mouse ESCs in being maintained by FGF and Activin/Nodal/TGFbeta signaling rather than by LIF and canonical Wnt signaling (Greber et al. 2010, reviewed in Katoh 2011). In human ESCs POU5F1 binds and directly activates the FGF2 gene, however Pou5f1 does not activate Fgf2 in mouse ESCs (reviewed in De Los Angeles et al. 2012). Differences in expression patterns of KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, ESRRB, FOXD3, SOCS3, LIN28, NODAL were observed between human and mouse ESCs (Cai et al. 2010) as were differences in expression of EOMES, ARNT and several other genes (Ginis et al.2004)." ;

                "Keratins are the major structural protein of vertebrate epidermis, constituting up to 85% of a fully differentiated keratinocyte (Fuchs 1995). Keratins belong to a superfamily of intermediate filament (IF) proteins that form alpha-helical coiled-coil dimers, which associate laterally and end-to-end to form approximately 10 nm diameter filaments. Keratin filaments are heteropolymeric, formed from equal amounts of acidic type I and basic /neutral type 2 keratins. Humans have 54 keratin genes (Schweitzer et al. 2006). They have highly specific expression patterns, related to the epithelial type and stage of differentiation. Roughly half of human keratins are specific to hair follicles (Langbein & Schweizer 2005). Keratin filaments bundle into tonofilaments that span the cytoplasm and bind to desmosomes and other cell membrane structures (Waschke 2008). This reflects their primary function, maintaining the mechanical stability of individual cells and epithelial tissues (Moll et al. 2008)." ;

                "Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation by which preadipocytes become adipocytes. During this process the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as hormone responsive lipogenenic and lipolytic programs. The most intensively studied model system for adipogenesis is differentiation of the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line by an induction cocktail of containing mitogens (insulin/IGF1), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), an inducer of cAMP (IBMX), and fetal serum (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Farmer 2006). More recently additional cellular models have become available to study adipogenesis that involve almost all stages of development (reviewed in Rosen and MacDougald 2006). In vivo knockout mice lacking putative adipogenic factors have also been extensively studied. Human pathways are traditionally inferred from those discovered in mouse but are now beginning to be validated in cellular models derived from human adipose progenitors (Fischer-Posovszky et al. 2008, Wdziekonski et al. 2011).<br>Adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors (Yeh et al. 1995, reviewed in Farmer 2006, Gesta et al. 2007). One of the first observable events during adipocyte differentiation is a transient increase in expression of the CEBPB (CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta, C/EBPB) and CEBPD (C/EBPD) transcription factors (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Lane et al. 1999). This occurs prior to the accumulation of lipid droplets. However, it is the subsequent inductions of CEBPA and PPARG that are critical for morphological, biochemical and functional adipocytes.<br>Ectopic expression of CEBPB alone is capable of inducing substantial adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts while CEBPD has a minimal effect. CEBPB is upregulated in response to intracellular cAMP (possibly via pCREB) and serum mitogens (possibly via Krox20). CEBPD is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids. The exact mechanisms that upregulate the CEBPs are not fully known.<br>CEBPB and CEBPD act directly on the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene by binding its promoter and activating transcription. CEBPB and CEBPD also directly activate the EBF1 gene (and possibly other EBFs) and KLF5 (Jimenez et al. 2007, Oishi 2005). The EBF1 and KLF5 proteins, in turn bind, and activate the PPARG promoter. Other hormones, such as insulin, affect PPARG expression and other transcription factors, such as ADD1/SREBP1c, bind the PPARG promoter. This is an area of ongoing research.<br>During adipogenesis the PPARG gene is transcribed to yield 2 variants. The adipogenic variant 2 mRNA encodes 30 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the widely expressed variant 1 mRNA.<br>PPARG encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor (remains in the nucleus in the absence of ligand) that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The heterodimer was initially identified as a complex regulating the aP2/FABP4 gene and named ARF6 (Tontonoz et al. 1994).<br>The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds a recognition sequence that consists of two hexanucleotide motifs (DR1 motifs) separated by 1 nucleotide. Binding occurs even in the absence of ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARG. In the absence of activating ligands, the PPARG:RXRA complex recruits repressors of transcription such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008).<br>Each molecule of PPARG can bind 2 molecules of activating ligands. Although, the identity of the endogenous ligands of PPARG is unknown, exogenous activators include fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (reviewed in Berger et al. 2005, Heikkinen et al. 2007, Lemberger et al. 1996). The most potent activators of PPARG in vitro are oxidized derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids.. Upon binding activating ligands PPARG causes a rearrangement of adjacent factors: Corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2 are lost and coactivators such as TIF2, PRIP, CBP, and p300 are recruited (Tontonoz and Spiegelman). PPARG also binds directly to the TRAP220 subunit of the TRAP/Mediator complex that recruits RNA polymerase II. Thus binding of activating ligand by PPARG causes transcription of PPARG target genes.<br>Targets of PPARG include genes involved in differentiation (PGAR/HFARP, Perilipin, aP2/FABP4, CEBPA), fatty acid transport (LPL, FAT/CD36), carbohydrate metabolism (PEPCK-C, AQP7, GK, GLUT4 (SLC2A4)), and energy homeostasis (LEPTIN and ADIPONECTIN) (Perera et al. 2006).<br>Within 10 days of differentiation CEBPB and CEBPD are no longer located at the PPARG promoter. Instead CEBPA is present. EBF1 and PPARG bind the CEBPA promoter and activate transcription of CEBPA, one of the key transcription factors in adipogenesis. A current hypothesis posits a self-reinforcing loop that maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state: PPARG activates CEBPA and CEBPA activates PPARG. Additionally EBF1 (and possibly other EBFs) activates CEBPA, CEBPA activates EBF1, and EBF1 activates PPARG." ;

                "During the development process cell migration and adhesion are the main forces involved in morphing the cells into critical anatomical structures. The ability of a cell to migrate to its correct destination depends heavily on signaling at the cell membrane. Erythropoietin producing hepatocellular carcinoma (EPH) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins (EPH receptors interacting proteins, EFNs), orchestrates the precise control necessary to guide a cell to its destination. They are expressed in all tissues of a developing embryo and are involved in multiple developmental processes such as axon guidance, cardiovascular and skeletal development and tissue patterning. In addition, EPH receptors and EFNs are expressed in developing and mature synapses in the nervous system, where they may have a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Activation of EPHB receptors in neurons induces the rapid formation and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as rapid synapse maturation (Dalva et al. 2007). On the other hand, EPHA4 activation leads to dendritic spine elimination (Murai et al. 2003, Fu et al. 2007).<br>EPH receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), with fourteen total receptors divided into either A- or B-subclasses: EPHA (1-8 and 10) and EPHB (1-4 and 6). EPH receptors can have overlapping functions, and loss of one receptor can be partially compensated for by another EPH receptor that has similar expression pattern and ligand-binding specificities. EPH receptors have an N-terminal extracellular domain through which they bind to ephrin ligands, a short transmembrane domain, and an intracellular cytoplasmic signaling structure containing a canonical tyrosine kinase catalytic domain as well as other protein interaction sites. Ephrins are also sub-divided into an A-subclass (A1-A5), which are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and a B-subclass (B1-B3), members of which have a transmembrane domain and a short, highly conserved cytoplasmic tail lacking endogenous catalytic activity. The interaction between EPH receptors and its ligands requires cell-cell interaction since both molecules are membrane-bound. Close contact between EPH receptors and EFNs is required for signaling to occur. EPH/EFN-initiated signaling occurs bi-directionally into either EPH- or EFN-expressing cells or axons. Signaling into the EPH receptor-expressing cell is referred as the forward signal and signaling into the EFN-expressing cell, the reverse signal. (Dalva et al. 2000, Grunwald et al. 2004, Davy & Robbins 2000, Cowan et al. 2004)" ;

                "Axon guidance / axon pathfinding is the process by which neurons send out axons to reach the correct targets. Growing axons have a highly motile structure at the growing tip called the growth cone, which senses the guidance cues in the environment through guidance cue receptors and responds by undergoing cytoskeletal changes that determine the direction of axon growth. <br>Guidance cues present in the surrounding environment provide the necessary directional information for the trip. These extrinsic cues have been divided into attractive or repulsive signals that tell the growth cone where and where not to grow. <br>Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the identification of highly conserved families of guidance molecules and their receptors that guide axons. These include netrins, Slits, semaphorins, and ephrins, and their cognate receptors, DCC and or uncoordinated-5 (UNC5), roundabouts (Robo), neuropilin and Eph. In addition, many other classes of adhesion molecules are also used by growth cones to navigate properly which include NCAM and L1CAM." ;

                "The L1 family of cell adhesion molecules (L1CAMs) are a subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily of transmembrane receptors, comprised of four structurally related proteins: L1, Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1), NrCAM, and Neurofascin. These CAMs contain six Ig like domains, five or six fibronectin like repeats, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain. The L1CAM family has been implicated in processes integral to nervous system development, including neurite outgrowth, neurite fasciculation and inter neuronal adhesion.<br>L1CAM members are predominately expressed by neuronal, as well as some nonneuronal cells, during development. Except CHL1 all the other members of L1 family contain an alternatively spliced 12-nclueotide exon, encoding the amino acid residues RSLE in the neuronal splice forms but missing in the non-neuronal cells. The extracellular regions of L1CAM members are divergent and differ in their abilities to interact with extracellular, heterophilic ligands. The L1 ligands include other Ig-domain CAMs (such as NCAM, TAG-1/axonin and F11), proteoglycans type molecules (neurocan), beta1 integrins, and extra cellular matrix protein laminin, Neuropilin-1, FGF and EGF receptors. Some of these L1-interacting proteins also bind to other L1CAM members. For example TAG-1/axonin interact with L1 and NrCAM; L1, neurofascin and CHL1 binds to contactin family members. The cytoplasmic domains of L1CAM members are most highly conserved. Nevertheless, they have different cytoplasmic binding partners, and even those with similar binding partners may be involved in different signaling complexes and mechanisms. The most conserved feature of L1CAMs is their ability to interact with the actin cytoskeletal adapter protein ankyrin. The cytoplasmic ankyrin-binding domain, exhibits the highest degree of amino acid conservation throughout the L1 family." ;

                "Synapse formation and maturation require multiple interactions between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. These interactions are mediated by a diverse set of synaptogenic proteins (Kegel et al. 2013, Siddiqui & Craig 2011). Initial synapse formation needs both the binding of secreted proteins to presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and the direct binding between presynaptic and postsynaptic transmembrane proteins. One class of molecules that plays an important role in cellular interactions in nervous system development and function is the leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI) protein family. These are secreted synaptogenic proteins consisting of an LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain and a epilepsy-associated or EPTP (epitempin) domain (Gu et al. 2002). Both protein domains are generally involved in protein-protein interactions. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of LGI proteins involves binding to a subset of cell surface receptors belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, i.e. ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23. These interactions play crucial role in the development and function of the vertebrate nervous system mainly mediating synaptic transmission and myelination (Kegel et al. 2013, Novak 2004, Seals & Courtneidge 2003)." ;

                "Signaling by NODAL is essential for patterning of the axes of the embryo and formation of mesoderm and endoderm (reviewed in Schier 2009, Shen 2007). The NODAL proprotein is secreted and cleaved extracellularly to yield mature NODAL. Mature NODAL homodimerizes and can also form heterodimers with LEFTY1, LEFTY2, or CERBERUS, which negatively regulate NODAL signaling. NODAL also forms heterodimers with GDF1, which increases NODAL activity. NODAL dimers bind the NODAL receptor comprising a type I Activin receptor (ACVR1B or ACVR1C), a type II Activin receptor (ACVR2A or ACVR2B), and an EGF-CFC coreceptor (CRIPTO or CRYPTIC). After binding NODAL, the type II activin receptor phosphorylates the type I activin receptor which then phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs). Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 form hetero-oligomeric complexes with SMAD4 (CO-SMAD) and transit from the cytosol to the nucleus. Within the nucleus the SMAD complexes interact with transcription factors such as FOXH1 to activate transcription of target genes." ;

                "The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed primarily in urogenital precursor cells, spermatogonocytes, dopaminergic neurons, motor neurons and neural crest progenitors and derived cells. . It is essential for kidney genesis, spermatogonial self-renewal and survivial, specification, migration, axonal growth and axon guidance of developing enteric neurons, motor neurons, parasympathetic neurons and somatosensory neurons (Schuchardt et al. 1994, Enomoto et al. 2001, Naughton et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006, Luo et al. 2006, 2009). RET was identified as the causative gene for human papillary thyroid carcinoma (Grieco et al. 1990), multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (Mulligan et al. 1993), type 2B (Hofstra et al. 1994, Carlson et al. 1994), and Hirschsprung's disease (Romeo et al. 1994, Edery et al. 1994). <br><br>RET contains a cadherin-related motif and a cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular domain (Takahashi et al. 1988). It is the receptor for members of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, GDNF (Lin et al. 1993), neurturin (NRTN) (Kotzbauer et al. 1996), artemin (ARTN) (Baloh et al. 1998), and persephin (PSPN) (Milbrandt et al. 1998), which form a family of neurotrophic factors. To stimulate RET, these ligands need a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptor, collectively termed GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA) (Treanor et al. 1996, Jing et al. 1996). The four members of this family have different, overlapping ligand preferences. GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and GFRA4 preferentially bind GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN, respectively (Jing et al. 1996, 1997, Creedon et al. 1997, Baloh et al. 1997, 1998, Masure et al. 2000). The GFRA co-receptor can come from the same cell as RET, or from a different cell. When the co-receptor is produced by the same cell as RET, it is termed cis signaling. When the co-receptor is produced by another cell, it is termed trans signaling. Cis and trans activation has been proposed to diversify RET signaling, either by recruiting different downstream effectors or by changing the kinetics or efficacy of kinase activation (Tansey et al. 2000, Paratcha et al. 2001). Whether cis and trans signaling has significant differences in vivo is unresolved (Fleming et al. 2015). Different GDNF family members could activate similar downstream signaling pathways since all GFRAs bind to and activate the same tyrosine kinase and induce coordinated phosphorylation of the same four RET tyrosines (Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096) with similar kinetics (Coulpier et al. 2002). However the exact RET signaling pathways in different types of cells and neurons remain to be determined." ;
